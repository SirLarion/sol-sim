The structure of the backend of the simulator has been implemented. 
Using the "Simulation" object bodies can be added, modified or removed from the simulation.
Implementing orbit calculation is still in-progress. This means the project is slightly behind
schedule. A new class, undefined in the plan called "Orbit" has been created. Instances of it
will have orbit defining values and each Body is connected to an Orbit instance.
So far the time used is around 10-15 hours

Orbit calculation for 2-body problems has been implemented. Rigorous testing is still required.
The GUI is taking shape. Graphics are displayed and some interaction with the simulation is possible.
The graphics are only 2-dimensional and they'll likely remain that way. It can be upgraded fairly easily
if there's time for it. However, implementing other key features is a priority. File I/O isn't being worked on
yet but is next in line. Overall workload has been 40-45 hours.

A little less work done since the last report. Some conversion to support 3-body problems was made such
as calculating the positions of the Bodies concurrently so that a new refreshed state can be achieved in less
time. In the process the GUI object saw some cleaning up as well.
60-70 hours work done.
